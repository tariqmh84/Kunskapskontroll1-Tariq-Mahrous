JS-Dom

I tried to make the task dynamic a little by adding reusable functions. Reusable functions are make implementing them to other elements easy as possible:

1. You can hover over the images, navigation menu and buy button to see background changing.

2. You can click on the arrow on product's image to flip over available colors. You will see the color's name change with image.

3. You press like button to see changing on item style and text.

4. You can delete item.

5. You can hit the BUY button of any product and see the bought items as a list.

6. Reset button to make the page return to static version.

7. Refresh button to reload the elements and previous mentioned functionality which added by JS.
